## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We will not take legal action against individuals who discover and report security vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them directly to us via email at:

*   Any **mitigation or remediation suggestions**, if you have them.

### Our Process

When you report a vulnerability to us, here is what you can expect:

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.

4.  **Resolution:** We will work to develop and release a patch as quickly as possible. The timeline for a fix will depend on the complexity of the vulnerability.
5.  **Public Disclosure & Credit:** Once a fix is released, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability. We believe in recognizing the work of security researchers and will gladly provide public credit for your discovery if you wish. We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you.
